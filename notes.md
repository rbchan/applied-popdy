# Notes for the future


## For 2022

- Shiny Apps for:
  * Metapop lecture
  * Geo/logistic growth
  * Others

- Improve BIDE to Geo derivation slides

- Don't ask students to pick good values of r, rmax and K in lab 2. Just give them values.

- Undergrads shouldn't do more than 1 or 2 exercises in R each week


## For 2021

- Read Yellowstone Wolves book chapter from 2020 book

- Use one of the final labs for Q&A session to help students finish final paper

- Grade first drafts earlier

- Ask Jake Knox to guest lecture towards end of semester

- Consider Microsoft Teams for group conversations, instead of GroupMe

- More on fecundity estimation 

- More details about pre-reproductive vs post-reproductive surveys

- Larger breakout rooms?

- Force R early if we're going to use it for estimation






## 2020 writing assignment

- First draft
  * Peer review
  * Add name and title
  * Use scientific writing style
     + Avoid first person
	 + Imitate the writing style in the papers that you cited
  * Fecundity is birth rate multiplied by s0
  * Abundance of each stage must be estimated at one point in time
  * All of the models should have stochasticity
    + Multiple runs for each scenario



## For 2020

- Make lab assignments more challenging by forcing them to develop
  their own model from scratch

- Make sure reading assignments are in correct order

- Mix source-sink and ideal free into metapop lecture

- Lake Herrick mark-recap:
  * Record lengths of fish species too small to tag
  * Record time of capture

- Consider moving extinction lab back further in the semester so they
  don't forget how to use stochastic models for the final project

- Provide an example of the final paper, perhaps from Chloe Green,
  Rachel Gardner,

- Add R tips and guidance to the lab assignments

- Provide more guidance for finding equilibrium solutions

- Streamline PRESENCE lab by combining "preliminaries" with other
  material... or switch everything to R and unmarked
