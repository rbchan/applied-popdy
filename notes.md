# Notes for the future


## For 2024

- Show deer data from N GA on body condition and density

- Quiz them on density dependent vs independent factors

- Use 4-5 questions in the quizzes, instead of 2-3. 

- Do M&M sampling exercise for mark-recapture

- Go back to using RMark for closed pop lab?

- Make tiger example more realistic (more money)

- Derive logistic growth from DD birth/death rates

- Stick with 3 age classes in age lecture

- Use predator-prey parameter notation in Williams et al. 

- Simplify harvest lab
  * Use new years
  * Be clear that pythons need to flatline

- Discussion: Is the universe random?

- Combine stochastic models and extinction lectures

- Improve PVA slides
  * Introduce the concepts of resilence, redundancy, and representation as used by the USFWS
  * Use a species status assessment, like the one I reviewed for GCWA
  
- Ditch short essays on final exam
  * Too much grading and too redundant with final project
  * Convert them to multiple choice scenarios

- Review previous lab materials and common issues at the beginning of each lab


## For 2023

- Ice-breaker
  * Name, major, primary interests

- Assign more papers
  * With mini-assignment
  * Group discussions

- Kahout

- chatGPT
  * Group presentation
    + Self-scoring

- Add more examples from Clutton-Brock, Krebs, etc...

- Need more group activities during lecture in second half of the semester

- Have a guest lecture earlier?

- Spend more time going over solutions from previous labs

- Make the labs shorter and easier to understand for undergrads
  * Especially the first few in which R is introduced
  
- Overhaul lecture on enviro/demographic stochasticity

- Provide example of final paper?

- Still need to improve items in notes below

- Kaplan-Meier survival lab
  * Move it earlier so students can incorporate into final paper

- Excel templates for data collectino
  * Add all names
  


## For 2022

- Add score item for estimation to final project rubric
  * Grad students only
  * Provide examples

- Use real datasets from Hastings and Krebs textbooks

- Add a page of general questions to the final exam

- TA expectations
  * They will gradually take over the labs as the semester progresses
  * Three field labs
  * Pick up vans
  * Grading
  * Attendance

- Go back to 'RMark' instead of 'mra' and 'marked'
  * Should be possible to run on Mac

- Guest speakers
  * Dave Shindle
  * Kirk Olson
    + Ask Kirk to show photos
  * Elina Garrison
  * Sarah Converse
  * Jose Jimenez
  * Ullas Karanth
  * Julien Martin
  * Jesse Whittington
  * Abby Sterling
  * Arno Lyet
  * Jhala Yadvendradev


- Shiny Apps for:
  * Metapop lecture
  * Geo/logistic growth
  * Others

- Improve BIDE to Geo derivation slides

- Don't ask students to pick good values of r, rmax and K in lab 2. Just give them values.

- Undergrads shouldn't do more than 1 or 2 exercises in R each week


## For 2021

- Read Yellowstone Wolves book chapter from 2020 book

- Use one of the final labs for Q&A session to help students finish final paper

- Grade first drafts earlier

- Ask Jake Knox to guest lecture towards end of semester

- Consider Microsoft Teams for group conversations, instead of GroupMe

- More on fecundity estimation 

- More details about pre-reproductive vs post-reproductive surveys

- Larger breakout rooms?

- Force R early if we're going to use it for estimation






## 2020 writing assignment

- First draft
  * Peer review
  * Add name and title
  * Use scientific writing style
     + Avoid first person
	 + Imitate the writing style in the papers that you cited
  * Fecundity is birth rate multiplied by s0
  * Abundance of each stage must be estimated at one point in time
  * All of the models should have stochasticity
    + Multiple runs for each scenario



## For 2020

- Make lab assignments more challenging by forcing them to develop
  their own model from scratch

- Make sure reading assignments are in correct order

- Mix source-sink and ideal free into metapop lecture

- Lake Herrick mark-recap:
  * Record lengths of fish species too small to tag
  * Record time of capture

- Consider moving extinction lab back further in the semester so they
  don't forget how to use stochastic models for the final project

- Provide an example of the final paper, perhaps from Chloe Green,
  Rachel Gardner,

- Add R tips and guidance to the lab assignments

- Provide more guidance for finding equilibrium solutions

- Streamline PRESENCE lab by combining "preliminaries" with other
  material... or switch everything to R and unmarked
