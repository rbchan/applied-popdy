# Notes for the future

## For 2020

- Make lab assignments more challenging by forcing them to develop
  their own model from scratch

- Make sure reading assignments are in correct order

- Mix source-sink and ideal free into metapop lecture

- Lake Herrick mark-recap:
  * Record lengths of fish species too small to tag
  * Record time of capture

- Consider moving extinction lab back further in the semester so they
  don't forget how to use stochastic models for the final project

- Provide an example of the final paper, perhaps from Chloe Green,
  Rachel Gardner,

- Add R tips and guidance to the lab assignments

- Provide more guidance for finding equilibrium solutions

- Streamline PRESENCE lab by combining "preliminaries" with other
  material... or switch everything to R and unmarked
