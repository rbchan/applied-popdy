\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
This course will present the theory necessary for understanding
wildlife population dynamics, and it will explain how to use theory
and data to inform management and conservation efforts.

\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students should know how to develop models
to forecast the impacts of environmental change and management actions
on wildlife populations. Students will learn how to design wildlife studies,
collect data, and estimate parameters such as abundance,
survival, and recruitment.

\section*{\normalsize Academic Honesty}
\vspace{-4mm}
% As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
% University's academic honesty policy, ``A Culture of Honesty,'' and
% the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards
% described in ``A Culture of Honesty'' found at:
% \url{https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/}. Lack of
% knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable
% explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments
% and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.
UGA Student Honor Code: ``I will be academically honest in all of my
academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others.'' A
Culture of Honesty, the University's policy and procedures for
handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at
\url{www.uga.edu/ovpi}.
