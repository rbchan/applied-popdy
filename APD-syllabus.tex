\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
This course will present the theory necessary for understanding
wildlife population dynamics, and it will explain how to use theory
and data to inform management and conservation efforts.

\vspace{-3mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students should know how to develop models
to forecast the impacts of environmental change and management actions
on wildlife populations. Students will learn how to design wildlife studies,
collect data, and estimate parameters such as abundance, survival, and
recruitment.

The plus/minus grading system will be used: %, according to UGA policy,
%and assigned following this plus/minus grading scale:
A = $>$93-100, A- = $>$90-93, B+ = $>$87-90,                     \\ B = $>$83-87,
B- = $>$80-83, C+ = $>$77-80, C = $>$73-77, C-= $>$70-73, D = 60-70, F = $<$60.

\section*{\normalsize Academic Honesty}
\vspace{-4mm}

UGA Student Honor code: ``I will be academically honest in all of my
academic work and will not tolerate academic dishonesty of others.'' A
Culture of Honesty, the University's policy and procedures for
handling cases of suspected dishonesty, can be found at
\url{https://honesty.uga.edu/}. You are responsible for 
informing yourself about the university's standards before performing
any academic work. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is
not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Please ask if you have
questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty
policy. Any form of possible academic dishonesty will be reported to
the UGA Office of the Vice President for Instruction.

\section*{\normalsize Format and Attendance}
\vspace{-4mm}
Lectures and labs will be in-person. Attendance is optional, but it
will be impossible to succeed in the class if you don't participate in
lectures and labs. Quizzes will be taken during lectures. 

\vspace{-12pt}
\section*{\normalsize Cell Phones and Laptops}
\vspace{-4mm}
Cell phones are not allowed during class unless explicit permission is
granted. Laptop computers should be brought to class for quizzes and
exercises.


\vspace{-12pt}
\section*{\normalsize Academic Coaching}
\vspace{-4mm}

For assistance with time management, test and performance anxiety,
notetaking, motivation, text comprehension, test preparation, and
other barriers to success at UGA, visit the
\href{https://dae.uga.edu/services/academic-coaching/}{Office of Academic Enhancement}. 

\vspace{-12pt}
\section*{\normalsize Accommodations for Disabilities}
\vspace{-4mm}

If you require a disability-required accommodation, it is essential
that you register with the Disability Resource Center (\url{https://drc.uga.edu}; 706-542-8719)
and notify me of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. We
can then plan how best to coordinate your accommodations. Please note
that accommodations cannot be provided retroactively.


\vspace{-12pt}
\section*{\normalsize Mental Health and Wellness Resources}
\vspace{-4mm}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{-6pt}
  \item If you or someone you know needs assistance, you are
    encouraged to contact \href{https://sco.uga.edu}{Student Care and
      Outreach} in the Division of Student Affairs (706-542-7774). They
    will help you navigate any difficult circumstances you may be facing
    by connecting you with the appropriate resources or services.
  \item UGA has several resources for a student seeking
    \href{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga}{mental health}
    % mental health services (\url{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga})
    or \href{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies}{crisis support}.% (\url{}).
  \item If you need help managing stress anxiety, relationships, etc.,
    please visit \href{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/bewelluga/bewelluga}{BeWellUGA} % (\url{})
    for a list of free workshops, classes, mentoring, and health
    coaching led by licensed clinicians and health educators in the
    University Health Center.
  \item Additional resources can be accessed through the UGA App.
\end{itemize}



\vspace{-12pt}
\section*{\normalsize Generative AI}
\vspace{-4mm}


Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like chatGPT and other generative AI
chatbots have become popular for editing text and computer code. However,
they often produce incorrect output, and they can hinder learning if
used to generate answers and bypass critical thinking. All work
submitted in this course must be your own work. Students can use
generative AI to edit their own text and code, but not to create
answers by inputting assignment questions into prompts. Students must
disclose the prompts provided to  AI tools, along with the original
text (or code) and the final text. Prompts and output can be disclosed
by copying and pasting screenshots into assignment documents. Failure
to disclose this information will be considered a violation of the UGA
Student Honor Code.
