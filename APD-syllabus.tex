\section*{Course Description}
\vspace{-2mm}
This course will present the theory necessary for understanding
wildlife population dynamics, and it will explain how to use theory
and data to inform management and conservation efforts.

\vspace{-5mm}
\section*{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-2mm}
By the end of the course, students should know how to develop models
to forecast the impacts of environmental change and management actions
on wildlife populations. Students will learn how to design studies,
collect data, and estimate parameters such as abundance,
survival, and recruitment.

\section*{Academic Honesty}
\vspace{-2mm}
As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the
University's academic honesty policy, ``A Culture of Honesty,'' and
the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards
described in ``A Culture of Honesty'' found at:
\url{https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/}. Lack of
knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable
explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments
and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Cell phones are not allowed during class unless explicit permission is
granted. Laptop computers should be brought to class for quizzes and
exercises.
