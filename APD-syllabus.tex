\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
This course will present the theory necessary for understanding
wildlife population dynamics, and it will explain how to use theory
and data to inform management and conservation efforts.

\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students should know how to develop models
to forecast the impacts of environmental change and management actions
on wildlife populations. Students will learn how to design wildlife studies,
collect data, and estimate parameters such as abundance,
survival, and recruitment.

and assigned following this plus/minus grading scale: A = 93-100, A- =
90-92.9, B+ = 87-89.9, B = 83-86.9, B- = 80-82.9, C+ = 77-79.9, C =
73-76.9, C-= 70-72.9, D = 60-69.9, F = $<$60.

\section*{\normalsize Attendance}
\vspace{-4mm}
Attendance is optional, but it will be impossible to succeed in the
class if you don't participate in either in-person or online
lectures. Quizzes will be taken during lectures.  

\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize COVID-19 adjustments}
\vspace{-4mm}
Per USG guidelines, students and instructors are required to wear a
face mask while inside instructional buildings. Face covering use is
in addition to, and is not a substitute for, appropriate
distancing. For course activities taking place outdoors, face
coverings are not required if distancing requirements are met. Anyone
not wearing a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or
must leave the area. Repeated refusal to comply with the requirement
may result in discipline through the applicable conduct code for
faculty, staff or students.

Reasonable accommodations may be made (through DRC) for those who are
unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. 

Prior to Thanksgiving Break, lectures and labs will be delivered
in-person, and they will be recorded and posted online. After
Thanksgiving Break, all lectures and labs will be delivered online. 

Online (remote) learning will involve both synchronous and
asynchronous activities.
