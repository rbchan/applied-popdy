\section*{\normalsize Course Description}
\vspace{-4mm}
This course will present the theory necessary for understanding
wildlife population dynamics, and it will explain how to use theory
and data to inform management and conservation efforts.

\vspace{-3mm}
\section*{\normalsize Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}
\vspace{-4mm}
By the end of the course, students should know how to develop models
to forecast the impacts of environmental change and management actions
on wildlife populations. Students will learn how to design wildlife studies,
collect data, and estimate parameters such as abundance,
survival, and recruitment.

% \section*{\normalsize COVID-19}
% \vspace{-4mm}
% Per USG guidelines, students and instructors are required to wear a
% face mask while inside instructional buildings. Face covering use is
% in addition to, and is not a substitute for, appropriate
% distancing. For course activities taking place outdoors, face
% coverings are not required if distancing requirements are met. Anyone
% not wearing a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or
% must leave the area. Repeated refusal to comply with the requirement
% may result in discipline through the applicable conduct code for
% faculty, staff or students.

% Reasonable accommodations may be made (through DRC) for those who are
% unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons. 

% Prior to Thanksgiving Break, lectures and labs will be delivered
% in-person, and they will be recorded and posted online. After
% Thanksgiving Break, all lectures and labs will be delivered online. 

% Online (remote) learning will involve both synchronous and
% asynchronous activities.



%\subsubsection*{DawgCheck}
%{\it DawgCheck}
%\vspace{-4mm}

% Please perform a quick symptom check each weekday on DawgCheck—on the
% UGA app or website—whether you feel sick or not. It will help health
% providers monitor the health situation on campus:

%{\it What do I do if I have symptoms?}
%\vspace{-4mm}

% Students showing symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an
% appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162

\section*{\normalsize Format and Attendance}
\vspace{-4mm}
Lectures and labs will be in-person. Attendance is optional, but it
will be impossible to succeed in the class if you don't participate in
lectures and labs. Quizzes will be taken during lectures. 

\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Cell Phones and Laptops}
\vspace{-4mm}
Cell phones are not allowed during class unless explicit permission is
granted. Laptop computers should be brought to class for quizzes and
exercises.

For assistance with time management, test and performance anxiety,
notetaking, motivation, text comprehension, test preparation, and
other barriers to success at UGA, visit the Office of Academic
Enhancement (\url{https://dae.uga.edu/services/academic-coaching/}). 

\vspace{-2mm}
\section*{\normalsize Accommodations for Disabilities}
\vspace{-4mm}

If you require a disability-required accommodation, it is essential
that you register with the Disability Resource Center (\url{https://drc.uga.edu}; 706-542-8719)

\section*{\normalsize Diversity and Inclusion}
\vspace{-4mm}
The phrase ‘diversity and inclusion’ encompasses welcoming and respect
for differences of culture, background and experience among
individuals and groups. Such differences include, but are not limited
to, differences of race, ethnicity, national origin, color, gender,
sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and abilities, as well as
political and religious affiliation and socioeconomic status. As UGA
grows more diverse, creating a welcoming climate of respect and
inclusiveness for all is more important than ever.

% \vspace{-4mm}

% The Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) grants
% students certain information privacy rights. To comply with FERPA, all
% communication that refers to individual students must be through a
% secure medium (UGAMail or eLC) or in person. Instructors are not
% allowed to respond to messages that refer to individual students or

% \section*{\normalsize COVID-19}

% {\bf Face coverings \\}
% Following guidance from the University System of Georgia, face
% coverings are recommended for all individuals while inside campus
% facilities. 

% {\bf How can I obtain the COVID-19 vaccine? \\}
% University Health Center is scheduling appointments for students
% through the UHC Patient Portal
% (\url{https://patientportal.uhs.uga.edu/login\_dualauthentication.aspx}). Learn
% more here – \url{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/healthtopics/covid-vaccine}. 

% The Georgia Department of Health, pharmacy chains and local providers
% also offer the COVID19 vaccine at no cost to you. To find a COVID-19
% vaccination location near you, please go to:
% \url{https://georgia.gov/covid-vaccine}. 

% In addition, the University System of Georgia has made COVID-19
% vaccines available at 15 campuses statewide and you can locate one
% here: \url{https://www.usg.edu/vaccination}

% {\bf What do I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?}
% Students showing COVID-19 symptoms should self-isolate and schedule an
% appointment with the University Health Center by calling 706-542-1162
% (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5p.m.). Please DO NOT walk-in. For emergencies
% and after-hours care, see, \url{https://www.uhs.uga.edu/info/emergencies}.

% {\bf What do I do if I test positive for COVID-19?}
% If you test positive for COVID-19 at any time, you are required to
% report it through the DawgCheck Test Reporting Survey. We encourage
% you to stay at home if you become ill or until you have excluded
% COVID-19 as the cause of your symptoms. UGA adheres to current Georgia
% Department of Public Health (DPH) quarantine and isolation guidance
% and requires that it be followed. Follow the instructions provided to
% you when you report your positive test result in DawgCheck.

% {\bf Guidelines for COVID-19 Quarantine Period} (As of 8/1/21) \\
% Students who are fully vaccinated do not need to quarantine upon
% exposure unless they have symptoms of COVID-19 themselves. All others
% should follow the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH)
% recommendations: Students who are not fully vaccinated and have been
% directly exposed to COVID-19 but are not showing symptoms should
% self-quarantine for 10 days. Those quarantining for 10 days must have
% been symptom-free throughout the monitoring period and continue
% self-monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms for a total of 14 days. You
% should report the need to quarantine on DawgCheck
% (\url{https://dawgcheck.uga.edu/}), and communicate directly with your
% faculty to coordinate your coursework while in quarantine. If you need
% additional help, reach out to Student Care and Outreach (sco@uga.edu)
% for assistance.
