## Overview

This site holds lecture and lab materials for Applied Population Dynamics (WILD 5700/7700, a course on population ecology and wildlife conservation). 

I just started building the website. Hope to have it finished by the end of the spring (2019)


More details can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

A GitHub repository with the source code is [here](https://github.com/rbchan/applied-popdy).

## History
This is a course that was originally developed by Mike Conroy and John Carroll.
