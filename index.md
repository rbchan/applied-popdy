## Overview

This site holds [lecture](lectures/lectures.md) and [lab](labs/labs.md) materials for Applied Population Dynamics (WILD 5700/7700), a course on population ecology and wildlife conservation at UGA. 

Students (primarily undergraduates) are exposed to basic theory in population ecology and to techniques for putting theory into practice. Topics include:

- Population models
  + The BIDE model
  + Exponential and logistic growth
  + Stage-structured matrix models
  + Metapopulation models
- Study design
- Parameter estimation
  + Distance sampling
  + Mark-recapture
  + Occupancy models

More details can be found in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

## History
This course was originally developed by Mike Conroy and John Carroll. I took over and revised it in the spring of 2014.
