## [Website](https://rbchan.github.io/applied-popdy/)

This repository holds the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts and the [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) files that I use to create my lecture and lab slides. You can access course materials here or through the accompanying [**website**](https://rbchan.github.io/applied-popdy/) built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).


## Overview
Students (primarily undergraduates) are exposed to basic theory in population ecology and to techniques for putting theory into practice. Topics include:

- Population models
  + The BIDE model
  + Exponential and logistic growth
  + Stage-structured matrix models
  + Metapopulation models
- Study design
- Parameter estimation
  + Distance sampling
  + Mark-recapture
  + Occupancy models

## History

Originally developed by Mike Conroy and John Carrol, I took over in the spring of 2014.
