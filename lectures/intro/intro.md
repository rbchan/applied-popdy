## Slides

[HTML slides](lecture-intro.html}

I normally make my slides using [Beamer](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer), but this is me experimenting with [xaringan](https://yihui.name/) 


## Handout

[Compressed version of the slides](lecture-intro-handout.pdf) with 4 slides per page


## R script and data

The [script](lab-t-tests.R) has the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code from the slides. It was automatically generated using [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/). You can ignore the comments and focus on the code.
