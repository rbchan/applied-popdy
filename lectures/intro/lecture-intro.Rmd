	   population size and structure? 
    2. How do environmental change and human activities 
	   (including management actions) affect population 
	   dynamics?

class: small


# Font size


.font-size: small

class: large

This should be smaller than

.font-size[large]

.small {try again}

.large {and again}

This isn't working. I guess [you have to define things in
CSS](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Font-Size).
