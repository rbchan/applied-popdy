Intro

  o Quiz

  o That most populations do not grow without limit is pretty
    clear. Resources get depleted. Turtles fall off logs

  o Explain logistic growth model. Plug in numbers

  o NOTE: We aren't going to cover continuous time versions

  o NOTE: Notation different from Conroy and Carroll book

  o Model isn't mechanistic. We don't know what vital rate is being affected.

  o Two schools of thought as to why not:
    - Andrewartha and Birch (1954) emphasized the role of catestrophic
      events in reducing population size
    - Density-dependence is an alternative

  o Logistic vs Ricker???

  o Allee effects

  o Regulating vs limiting factors

  o Chaos, overshooting
