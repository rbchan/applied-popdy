INTRO

  o Annoucements: 
    - Marshmallow prize
    - Mention exam
    - Writing assignment
    - Bonus points class

  o Age distribution data are no good

  o Moving from closed to open populations
    - We could estimate N each year using distance sampling or
      capture-recapture, but we wouldn't learn anything about the
      factors contributing to population growth
    - Vital rates can be estimated using telemetry or
      capture-recapture


TELEMETRY

  o Work through Kaplan-Meier example

  o Consequences of violating Kaplan-Meier assumption:
    - Survival will be overestimated


AGE DISTRIBUTIOn

  o Don't do this
