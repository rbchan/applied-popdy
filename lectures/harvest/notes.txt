Intro

  o Final part of course. How do we use models in practice?

  o Mention book

  o Population harvesting is one of the most important tools for
    managing populations. In the US, money from hunting taxes supports
    many conservation efforts

  o How do you set a harvest limit?
    - Need a model that will predict impacts of harvest
    - Goal is to achieve sustainable harvest
    - In reality, politics play important role
      - Many special interests: hunters, landowners, animal rights
      	activists

  o Exponential growth, work out the equation

  o Problems with this model?

  o Logistic growth, same.. .

  o Ask students to work out the equation for MSY
    - Put up answers on socrativ

  o Doomed surplus: Difference between potential growth and actual
    growth gives opportunity to harvest without decimating population
    - Ask how many mallards are shot each year
    - How many deer are killed each year?


  o Limitations of MSY... perhaps we just need a better model

  o NPR story

  o Explain equation for a line

  o Answer questions on socrativ
