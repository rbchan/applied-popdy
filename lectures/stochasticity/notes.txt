  o Quiz

  o Title slide:
    - Real data is like a wake up call.
    - All models are wrong. Theoretical (deterministic) models especially so.
    - Could we explain each data point?
    - Could we predict the next data point?

  o Examples of stochastic processes in daily life
    - Weather
    - Our own behavior
    - Population size (N)

  o X~N(mu,var). Define parameters. Explain that X could be anything

  o Purely stochatic models might look good, but they don't tell us anything. How could N(t+1) not depend on N(t)?

  o Do we live in a stochastic world
    - Yes, thankfully
    - We don't even know what we are going to do with ourselves
    - But are the rules deterministic? Tough question.
