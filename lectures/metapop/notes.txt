SPATIAL

  o 2 pieces of bad news: no quiz, this stuff is hard

  o Today's lab: metapop exercise and exam review

  o You already noticed 2 big problems with the non-spatial model
    - Colonization should depend on distance
    - Rescue effect

  o Another one is that a population can't go extinct

  o Here I should do a game with bean bags and coins or something

  o Colonization kernels: calculate one

  o Hard part is that you have to think about all neighbors

  o For probability rules, be sure to draw a diagram
