## Course Description and Objectives
This course will present the theory necessary for understanding wildlife population dynamics, and it will explain how to use theory and data to inform management and conservation efforts. By the end of the course, students should know how to develop models to forecast the impacts of environmental change and management actions on wildlife populations. Students will learn how to design studies, collect data, and estimate parameters such as abundance, survival, and recruitment.

All academic work must meet the standards contained in the University's [academic honesty policy](https://honesty.uga.edu/).  All students are responsible for informing themselves about those standards before performing any academic work.  The [penalties for academic dishonesty](https://honesty.uga.edu/Academic-Honesty-Policy/Consequences_for_Honesty_Violations/) are severe, and ignorance is not an acceptable defense.
